Etch-a-sketch project

by Letícia Rodrigues

This is a project made with the purpose of applying what I learned from the first front-end course of The Odin Project. The objectives I expect to accomplish are learning how to manage a project with git and github; how to create a responsive web-page using HTML and CSS; how to use JavaScript and jQuery properly in webpages; how to make something dynamic; and experience to make ideas into true projects.

I'm starting this project on september 24th 2017 in São Paulo, Brazil.
